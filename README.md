# ✨ Femiaculture ✨
🌱 During my thesis, I researched factors influencing rural farm women’s empowerment in agricultural development.
Within this master thesis, I applied a literature research and the Decision Analysis methodologie to assess the unequal resource distribution between male and female farmers and to evaluate how gender can be captured in modeling efforts.
