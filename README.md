# âœ¨ Femiaculture âœ¨
ðŸŒ± During my thesis, I researched factors influencing rural farm womenâ€™s empowerment in agricultural development.
Within this master thesis, I applied a literature research and the Decision Analysis methodologie to assess the unequal resource distribution between male and female farmers and to evaluate how gender can be captured in modeling efforts.

- A) Show process to scientists
- B) Communicate with supervisors
- C) Present results to scientists in the end

ðŸ’¬ and furthermore scientists can adapt the core code ...

- for farm women 
- for Decision Analysis workshop participants

Please note (!):
For the first sliders, you need to insert ranges (for example, from x to y) and no constant values.
The last five inputs are constant. Please set the slider to one number instead of a range for the application to work properly here.

Please wait a second for the error warning to disappear after changing the inputs.
